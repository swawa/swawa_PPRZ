[NJ][0xFF][Rejoin Policy][E;0-0xFF][Set/read the end device rejoin policy. If an end device loses communication with its parent, it must find a new parent to operate on the network. If NJ=0xFF, the end device assumes permit-joining is always enabled on the network and joins through association. Otherwise, the end device assumes permit-joining may not be enabled and first tries rejoining the network to acquire a new parent.]
[JN][0][Join Notification][C;Disabled; Enabled][Set/read the join notification setting. If enabled, the module will transmit a broadcast node identification frame on power up and when joining.

The maximum RF payload per unicast packet is limited to 66 bytes if security is enabled (EE) or 84 otherwise. Source routing and fragmentation, if used, may further reduce the maximum RF payload size. Broadcast RF packets allow 8 more bytes than unicast.]
